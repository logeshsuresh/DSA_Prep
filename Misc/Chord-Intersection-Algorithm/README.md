# Chord Intersection Algorithm

## Overview

This algorithm determines the number of intersections among a set of chords represented by their start and end radians. It checks for intersections by comparing the relative positions of the start and end radians of each chord.

## Algorithm Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The algorithm takes user input for the number of chords and their corresponding radians.

2. **Label Generation**:
    - Labels are generated for each chord, distinguishing between start ('s1', 's2', ...) and end ('e1', 'e2', ...) points.

3. **Chord Mapping**:
    - The algorithm constructs a dictionary, `chord_map`, mapping each chord number to its start and end radians.

4. **Intersection Check**:
    - The algorithm iterates over pairs of chords, checking for intersections based on their start and end radians.

5. **Intersection Conditions**:
    - Four conditions are checked for potential intersections between two chords, involving comparisons of their start and end radians. There would definitely be an intersection between two chords c1, c2 if the starting point of c1 lies between the starting and ending points of c2 and the ending point of c1 does not lie between the starting and ending points of c2.

6. **Counting Intersections**:
    - The algorithm increments a counter, `num_intersections`, whenever it finds intersecting pairs of chords.

7. **Output**:
    - The total number of intersections among the chords is reported as the final output.

## Time Complexity Analysis

- **Input Handling**: O(N)
- **Label Generation**: O(N)
- **Chord Mapping**: O(N)
- **Intersection Check**: O(N^2)
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(N^2)

## Space Complexity Analysis

- **Radians List**: O(N)
- **Labels List**: O(N)
- **Chord Mapping**: O(N)
- **Chord Pair Set**: O(N^2)
- **Total Space Complexity**: O(N^2)

## Algorithm Summary

- The algorithm efficiently identifies intersections among chords using a systematic approach based on their start and end radians.
- It achieves a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(N^2), suitable for moderate-sized chord datasets.
